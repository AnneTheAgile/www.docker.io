interact with other talented developers and devops professionals, increase awareness of the work that you are doing,
improve your skills, or give back.

### Get in Touch ##

There are several ways to get in touch:

* Join the discussion on IRC. We can be found in the #docker channel on chat.freenode.net
* Discussions happen on our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/docker-club)
* All our development and decisions are made out in the open on [Github](github.com/dotcloud/docker)
* Get help on using Docker by asking on [Stackoverflow]()
* Star or Watch the Project on [GitHub](http://github.com/dotcloud/docker)
* Follow Us on Twitter: @getdocker
* And of course, tweet your tweets to twitter.com/getdocker

## Share

Sharing what you have built with Docker is a great way to help people understand the value of Docker. If you have
    a great story to tell we will be happy to help you spread the word.

* Tell your story at a company tech talk, tweet (#docker.io, @getdocker)  present at your local user group, or submit a
    talk proposal to a conference or event about how you are using Docker
* If you are using Docker,  in production, become a public reference like [these](http://blog.docker.io/2013/07/docker-projects-from-the-docker-community/)
* Write a tutorial  like [these](http://blog.docker.io/2013/06/14-great-tutorials-on-docker/)

### Come to (or organize) a meetup ###

Docker meetups  are a great way to network, learn, share best practices, and have fun.

* Find or organize a [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-meetups/)

### Share or Create New Dockerized Apps ###
There are over 1,000 cool, containerized applications in our public Index.

* Search for containers in the [Index](https://index.docker.io/)
* Publish containers at the Index
* Better yet, create a Dockerfile and put it in your repository, to make creation of new containers automatic


## Contribute

An Open Source project like Docker couldn’t exist without contributions from the developer community.
    As of June 30, 2013, there are over 100 contributors and nearly 400 forks on the project.

* Take a look at our [issues list](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/issues?state=open) and consider submitting a patch
* Review our roadmap on [GitHub](github.com/dotcloud/docker) and provide feedback
* Consider [contributing](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Like the program itself, we run the [**documentaion**](http://docs.docker.io) as an open source project. The sources are
    available from the main [docker repository](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/tree/master/docs) on Github, and we
    encourage you to make improvements, whether big or small, make a pull request.

### Work on Docker ###
Like to hack on Docker? Work on it full time! Come look at our [jobs](http://dotcloud.theresumator.com/apply/) listing.
