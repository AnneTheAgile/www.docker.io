# an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container #

{% endblock %}


{% block copy_introduction %}
Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application.
    The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal,
    OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more. <span class="read-more"><a href="{% url 'about' %}" title="About Docker">Read more -></a></span>
