{% block copy_introduction %}

Docker is an open-source project which allows you to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers
    from your application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in
    production, on VMs, bare metal servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or combinations of the above.
